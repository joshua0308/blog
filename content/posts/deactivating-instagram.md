A couple weeks ago, I decided to deactivate Instagram because I found myself wasting too much time watching short-form videos (a.k.a. Reels) everyday.

I never open Instagram with the intention of watching those videos, but I always find myself scrolling through them mindlessly. It's like a digital black hole where time melts away before I know it's too late. The next thing I know, I'm 30-60 minutes deep into passively devouring content that I would probably be better off without. These little bits of time add up and amount to a couple of hours every week! After realizing how much precious time I've been throwing away, I've decided that I'm not going to let other people steal my time anymore. I want more control over my time and to be intentional about it.

So far, it's been great. My screen time is now under 2 hours per day. I have more time to do other things like writing this blog post. The blog will be my new outlet for self-expression now that I don't get to post Instagram stories anymore. I hope that this will stick and I get to write a follow-up blog post on "Qutting Instagram".
