A couple weeks ago, I decided to deactivate my Instagram account. Why? I found myself spending too much time watching Reels, which is Instagram's clone of Tiktok. For the same reason, I deleted Youtube from my phone.

I never open Instagram or Youtube with the intention of watching those short-form videos but I somehow always end up watching them mindlessly. It is like a blackhole that sucks you in without you noticing. Next thing you know, you've spent half an hour consuming content that you did not ask for. The real problem is that I never had the intention of spending hours watching these videos every week. I want to be more intenetional about how I spend my time. I do not want others stealing time away from me. 

So far, it has been working great. My screen time is now under 2 hours per day. I have more time to do other things like writing this blog post. The blog will be my new outlet for self-expression now that I don't get to post Instagram stories anymore. I hope that this will stick and I get to write a follow-up blog post on "Qutting Instagram".
